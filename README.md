# seqrepo-rest-api

Provides SeqRepo and GA4GH RefGet REST interfaces to biological sequences and sequence metadata from an existing
[seqrepo](https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo/) sequence repository.

## Important changes

**Breaking Change (July 2022): SEQREPO_DIR is now ignored.  You must pass the seqrepo instance directory explicitly.
See examples below.**

## Description

Specific, named biological sequences provide the reference and coordinate sysstem for communicating variation and
consequential phenotypic changes. Several databases of sequences exist, with significant overlap, all using distinct
names. Furthermore, these systems are often difficult to install locally. 

Clients refer to sequences and metadata using familiar identifiers, such as NM_000551.3 or GRCh38:1, or any of several
hash-based identifiers.  The interface supports fast slicing of arbitrary regions of large sequences.

A "fully-qualified" identifier includes a namespace to disambiguate accessions (e.g., "1" in GRCh37 and GRCh38). If the
namespace is provided, seqrepo uses it as-is.  If the namespace is not provided and the unqualified identifier refers to
a unique sequence, it is returned; otherwise, ambiguous identifiers will raise an error.

SeqRepo favors identifiers from [identifiers.org](identifiers.org) whenever available.  Examples include
[refseq](https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/refseq) and
[ensembl](https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/ensembl).

This repository is the REST interface only.  The underlying data is provided by
[seqrepo](https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo/).

This repository also implements the [GA4GH refget (v1) protocol](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/refget.html) at
`<baseurl>/refget/`.

## Examples

### OpenAPI docs

The REST interface is implemented with OpenAPI. Current and
interactive documentation is available at the base url for the
endpoint.

### Fetch Sequence

Fetch sequence by an accession:

    $ curl -f http://0.0.0.0:5000/seqrepo/1/sequence/NP_001274413.1
    MERSFVWLSCLDSDSCNLTFRLGEVESHACSPSLLWNLLTQYLPPGAGHILRTYNFPVLSCVSSCHLIGGKMPEN

Or not:

    $ curl -f http://0.0.0.0:5000/seqrepo/1/sequence/bogus
    curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404 NOT FOUND

Popular digests are also available:

    $ curl -f http://0.0.0.0:5000/seqrepo/1/sequence/MD5:d52770ec477d0c9ee01fa034aff62cb4
    MERSFVWLSCLDSDSCNLTFRLGEVESHACSPSLLWNLLTQYLPPGAGHILRTYNFPVLSCVSSCHLIGGKMPEN

With range:

    # ðŸ‘‰ Seqrepo uses interbase coordinates.
    $ curl -f "http://0.0.0.0:5000/seqrepo/1/sequence/NP_001274413.1?start=5&end=10"
    VWLSC

### Fetch Metadata

    $ curl -f "http://0.0.0.0:5000/seqrepo/1/metadata/GRCh38:1"
    {
      "added": "2016-08-27T21:17:00Z",
      "aliases": [
        "GRCh38:1",

## Development

    $ make devready
    $ source venv/bin/activate

## Running a local instance

Once installed as above, you should be able to:

    $ seqrepo-rest-service /usr/local/share/seqrepo/2021-01-29

The navigate to the URL shown in the console output.


## Building and running a docker image

A docker image can be built with this repo or pulled from [docker
hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/biocommons/seqrepo-rest-service).  In either case, the container requires an existing
local [seqrepo](https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo/) sequence repository.  

To build a docker image in this repo:

    make docker-image

This will create biocommons/seqrepo-rest-service:lastest, like this:

    $ docker images 
    REPOSITORY                        TAG     IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
    biocommons/seqrepo-rest-service   latest  ad9ca051c5c9   2 minutes ago    627MB

This docker image is periodically pushed to docker hub.

Invoke the docker image like this this:

    docker run \
      --name seqrepo-rest-service \
      --detach --rm -p 5000:5000 \
      -v /usr/local/share/seqrepo/2021-01-29:/mnt/seqrepo \
      biocommons/seqrepo-rest-service \
      seqrepo-rest-service /mnt/seqrepo

You should then be able to fetch a test sequence like this:

    $ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/seqrepo/1/sequence/refseq:NM_000551.3?end=20'

If things aren't working, check the logs with `docker logs -f seqrepo-rest-service`.
